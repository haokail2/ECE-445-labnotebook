team meeting for design document and continue on PCB design

2025-03-06

team meeting for finishing design document

We were trying to figure out what components we are going to use and where to get them

2025-03-10

test temperature senor on breadboard

We finished the temperature sensor on the breadborad first, it worked successfully. We also tested the sensor in different temperature, it worked well.

2025-03-13

finish first version of PCB design


2025-04-16

fix some PCB design issues and make second version of PCB

We didn't have connectors to turbidity and temperature sensors on PCB

contiune on build and testing sensors

Our second version of PCB still have some issues with ESP32 chip, we decidede to switch to ESP32 dev board and solder it on the PCB.

finilizing our project

We only have temperature and turbidity sensors working correctly. There were some PCB design issues that make other sensors can't get correct readings.
